# RealmWeaver-AI - Procedural Game Asset Generator

**RealmWeaver-AI** is a procedural 2D game asset generation framework that combines the power of **generative AI** and **Unity game development**. The system automates the creation of game-ready assets such as terrain tiles, environment props, and complete biome maps, helping indie developers reduce the time and effort needed for building immersive game worlds.

## üîß Core Components

- **Stable Diffusion**  
  Generates top-down terrain tiles and props from text prompts conditioned on biome and style.

- **CVAE-GAN (Conditional Variational Autoencoder GAN)**  
  Learns structural features from tiles to generate diverse and coherent tilemaps.

- **Wave Function Collapse Algorithm**  
  Helps generate procedurally varied but spatially consistent biome maps.

- **Unity Integration**  
  Automates prefab generation, reads biome CSVs, and renders maps using scripted tile placement.
